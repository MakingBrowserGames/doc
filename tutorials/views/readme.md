## Views

A view is the most basic display element, everything on the screen is or extends a view.
The application contains a view which is the root view. All views in the application are
children of the root view.

The structure of the views is a tree, each view has properties and methods to navigate
the view hierarchy.

**View demos:**

- [nested](@todo nested/readme.html)
- [add/remove](@todo addremove/readme.html)

[This demo](@todo basic/readme.html) shows the most basic application with a single view possible.

Views can be nested as shown in [this demo](@todo nested/readme.html).

### Adding and removing views

A view is positioned relative to its parent view which is demonstrated [here](@todo addremove/readme.html).
