# Android Development Guide

This guide takes you through the entire process of developing for Android devices with the Game Closure SDK.

## Overview

The development cycle can be broken down into [four stages](./android-stages.html), leading up to deployment on Google Play.  Initially, all development is done with [web tools](../guide/quick-start.html) and emulated devices.

Then the [Test App](./android-test-app.html) is used to accelerate transition onto the mobile devices.

Then [iOS building](./ios-build.html) is encouraged to test and demo your game, with the help of [remote debugging](./android-remote-debug.html) tools.

Finally your app is ready for deployment via Google Play.

## Setup

The [Game Closure SDK setup guides](./android-setup.html) will get you up and running as fast as possible.

## Test App

With the [Test App](./android-test-app.html) you can quickly iterate through changes to your game on a mobile device.

## Build

When you are ready to start building your game, the [build guide](./android-build.html) will make the process smooth and showcase all of the powerful options available.

## Remote Debugging

The integrated [remote JavaScript debugging](./android-remote-debug.html) allows you to isolate and annihilate *all* the bugs.

## Troubleshooting

There is a brief troubleshooting guide available [here](./android-troubleshooting.html).
