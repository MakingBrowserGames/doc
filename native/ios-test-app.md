# iOS Test App

Test your game code live on the device with the [Game Closure Test App](./test_app.html).  You will host a server on your computer, and setup your mobile device to use WiFi.  Build and run the Test App on your device using XCode.

Select your server from the on-screen list, then select which game to test.  Making code changes on your computer can be pushed quickly to the device by restarting the game with a circular gesture (See Restarting below).

The same Chrome [Web Inspector interface](./ios-remote-debug.html) may be used to investigate coding errors on the mobile device from the comfort of your computer.  Using the Native Tools feature you can investigate coding errors and view the console logs of Test App sessions.
