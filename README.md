# Game Closure SDK Documentation

## Layout

This repository is separated in to the following directories:

* `api` ---Contains the markdown files used to generate the
  API Reference, ordered by namespace.
* `guide` ---Contains the markdown files used to generate
  user guides, ordered by difficulty.
* `examples` ---JavaScript sample code that is inserted in to the documentation.
* `html` ---The html documentation generated by the markdown files.
* `build` ---Scripts used to build the documentation.

## Editing

All documentation is written in markdown and converted to html
using Pandoc. Subsequently, any of Pandoc's [supported syntax](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html) 
will work in these documents.

Simple, trivial, edits can be done directly through the
GitHub interface. Simply select the file and click the
*Edit* button in the top-right corner. Make your
modification and submit a commit message. This will be
applied directly to the branch you are browsing (probably
**master**), so some care should be taken.

For non-trivial edits it is best to create a separate branch
and submit a pull request, the same as other software projects.

## Wiki

Additional documentation that is not yet in the API reference
or usage guides can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/gameclosure/doc/wiki)
of this repo.

## Build Local

To build a local copy of the documentation you need to
install [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) and
[m4](http://www.gnu.org/software/m4/) on your machine. This
is used to convert the markdown to html, 

With the prerequisites installed, simply run the shell script:

~~~
$ ./build/make-doc
~~~

This will output the generated documentation in the `html` directory.

## Build Remote

If generating documentation for `doc.gameclosure.com`, log in
to the server, change to the directory `/home/doc/src/doc`,
and run the following commands as the `doc` user:

~~~
$ sudo -u doc git pull
$ sudo -u doc ./build/make-doc
~~~

This will update the repository and build the documentation
that is served from the web.
