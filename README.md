Welcome to **Game Closure**! We hope you enjoy your stay with us. To help accelerate the assimilation processes, we have created a guide outlining the recommended way of doing things regarding development. On completion of the tests, you will receive cake.

Ready to dive in? Start with *[Respecting The Environment](https://github.com/gameclosure/intro/blob/master/ENVIRONMENT.md)*.

*(personal advice: I've found that the best way to learn quickly is to pay attention and ask lots of questions. One way is to watch the GC GitHub news feed: See an interesting commit? Take a look. Maybe it adds a new feature to use on Android! Having an up to date idea on what everyone is working on at the moment can potentially help both you and them. Next, don't be afraid to research and ask for help: See a cool feature in a game? Check out the source, ask questions about it, maybe you'll learn something. Run into a hard problem? Talk about it. -Teddy)*
