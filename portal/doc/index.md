## Introduction

Welcome to the Game Closure SDK documentation. If you are just getting started, you should
checkout our [Getting Started Guide](./guides/getting-started.html) to guide you through the process and acquaint yourself
with the Game Closure terms and way of life.

But before you start hacking away, consult our [Installation Guide](./guides/build-start.html) to get all
the files you need.
