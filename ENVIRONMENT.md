Various tools recommended for development. Skip anything you've already done, which is probaby most of it, but read through to make sure.

**Xcode** - You'll need this for Homebrew and building stuff on iOS.
	1. Download and run the installer from the Mac App Store.

**Homebrew** - An awesome package manager for OS X, with a huge up to date selection including core UNIX utilities (`wget`) and even full programs (`wine`). You'll also need it for `git`, `node`, etc. Other options exist but this is highly preferred.
	1. Download and install it using the command from https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/installation.
	<!-- list of bash commands, maybe? -->

**Git** - You'll be using this a lot.
	1. You'll probably want it from Homebrew, so:
	2. `$ brew install git`
	3. Follow the instructions on [help.github.com](http://help.github.com/mac-set-up-git/) to configure it.

**Node** - Needed for the SDK. You can also test JavaScript or run, say, a level generator with it.
	1. `$ brew install node`

<!-- probably a bunch of python stuff, so pip/virtualenv/etc. -->

**Android tools** - Android DKs needed for building android stuff.
	1. `$ brew install android-sdk`
	2. `$ brew install android-ndk`
	<!-- downloading the android stuff via `android` -->
