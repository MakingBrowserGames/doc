# Intro

These docs represent a subset of the game engine API---the
tip of the iceberg---that most games are using. These notes
serve as an entry point into the SDK and are not the
"official" documentation. If you understand how these
classes work together, well, that's something I guess.

If you are an absolute beginner, checkout the [Getting Started Guide](../getting-started.md).

The classes here can be divided into a few sections:

First, you need to create an [application](./application.md).

Create views:
* [View](./timestep/view.md)
* [ImageView](./timestep/imageview.md)
* [TextView](./timestep/textview.md)

More complex views:
* [ScrollView](./timestep/scrollview.md)
* [List](./timestep/ui/list.md)

Messaging:
* [PubSub](./lib/pubsub.md)

Animation:
* [Animate](./timestep/animate.md)
* [Sprite](./timestep/sprite.md)
