## Events

Events can be used to respond to a changing condition.
Most classes in the SDK extend the Emitter class which
allows them to publish events.

The events demos show you how to publish and subscribe
to an event and how to publish an event once and the remove
the subscriber.

All samples can be found in the `example` tab in the SDK
which allows you to run them immediately.

The [Emitter class](@todo link to emitter) documentation can be
found [here](@todo link to emitter).

**Event demos:**
- [on](@todo on/readme.html)
- [pubsub](@todo pubsub/readme.html)
- [once](@todo once/readme.html)

### Capturing an event with _on_

[This demo](@todo on/readme.html) shows how to use [publish and on](@todo on/readme.html).

### Publishing and subscribing

[This demo](@todo pubsub/readme.html) shows how to use [publish and subscribe](@todo pubsub/readme.html).

### Capturing an event once

Sometimes you want to have an signal which is only emitted once for example
a view which passes a certain location threshold.
[This example](@todo once/readme.html) shows you how to do this.
